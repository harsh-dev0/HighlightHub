## 💡 Idea

Many creators struggle to repurpose long videos into engaging short content.  
Script2Shorts solves that by taking in a script (or transcript) and automatically creating a 30-second video summary with:

- AI summarization
- Voiceover generation
- Background music
- Auto-edited visuals (Remotion or ffmpeg.wasm)

---

## 🔧 Planned Tech Stack

- `Next.js` + `TailwindCSS`
- `Remotion` or `ffmpeg.wasm`
- `OpenAI` (for summarization)
- `ElevenLabs` (for voiceover)
- `Supabase` (for auth + storage)

---
